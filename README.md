Check-Ins

* Standups (what did you do yesterday, what will you do today, are you blocked on anything)
  * During scheduled work time.
  * Slack message of the same information as above on the weekend.

Project Organization

Approaches to Project Organization

* We all discussed tools we've used in the past and compared a few.
* We wanted a project management tool with cards to show the project's progress as well as a tool to create graphical flowcharts to visualize the workflow.
* Ultimately the final decision on tools were made by group consensus.

Approaches to Code Design

* Logically ordered the various datasets by level of dependency and encapsulation.
* Utilized flowchart to collaborate on the structure by comparing the CSV data.

Initial DTR Link
